# GTXpresso - Cross-Chain CLOB DEX

GTXpresso is a **cross-chain Central Limit Order Book (CLOB) decentralized exchange** powered by **Espresso**, leveraging its cutting-edge rollup technology for **sequencing, interoperability, and trading efficiency**.

## üöÄ Overview

GTXpresso utilizes **Espresso's high-performance rollup infrastructure** to enable **decentralized, low-cost, and cross-chain** trading. Built with the **Open Intents Framework**, it supports **intent-based trading across EVM-compatible chains**, ensuring secure and efficient execution.

With **ERC-7683 support**, GTXpresso facilitates **standardized cross-chain transactions**, allowing seamless intent activation across the Ethereum ecosystem.

## üîë Key Components

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ CLOB Contracts

- **Deployed on an Espresso-powered rollup** for efficient order placement, matching, and settlement.
- Refference: https://github.com/Great-Trading-eXperience/clob-dex/tree/feature/swap

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Espresso-Powered Rollup

- **Arbitrum Orbit L3 rollup** utilizing **Espresso's shared sequencing** for enhanced trading performance.
- **Parent Chain:** Arbitrum Sepolia
- Built on **Arbitrum Nitro**, integrating **Espresso confirmations** for improved sequencing and interoperability.
- Optimized for **high-speed, low-cost transactions**.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Hyperlane Bridge Mechanism

- **Core and Warp Routes** deployed for cross-chain message passing and liquidity bridging.
- Enables **secure and efficient** asset movement across chains.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Open Intents Contracts

- Implements **ERC-7683-based contracts** for **on-chain intent creation and settlement**.
- Facilitates seamless execution using **Hyperlane's messaging infrastructure**.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Solver

- **Off-chain solver node** that listens for new intents on the rollup.
- **Executes orders** on destination chains based on user-defined actions.

## ‚ö° The Problem

On-chain trading still faces key challenges:

- **High Gas Costs** ‚Äì While rollups reduce fees, active trading remains costly.
- **Execution Bottlenecks** ‚Äì Many rollups rely on centralized sequencers, causing delays and reordering risks.
- **Liquidity Fragmentation** ‚Äì Liquidity remains siloed across different rollups, making cross-rollup trading inefficient.

## üåü Why Espresso?

Espresso **solves these issues** by offering:

- ‚úÖ **Decentralized & Shared Sequencing** ‚Äì Removes centralized sequencers for **fair & transparent** transaction ordering.
- ‚ö° **Low Latency** ‚Äì Faster block times enable **near-instant execution**, crucial for high-frequency trading.
- üí∞ **Lower Costs** ‚Äì Transactions are **significantly cheaper** than L1s and traditional L2s.
- üîÑ **Cross-Chain Liquidity** ‚Äì Seamless integration with **Hyperlane** enables **frictionless multi-chain trading**.
- üöÄ **Optimized Trading Infrastructure** ‚Äì Advanced sequencing mechanisms tailored for **high-performance decentralized trading**.

## üîç How GTXpresso Enables Cross-Chain Trading

### üõ†Ô∏è Key Technologies

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Hyperlane Interoperability**

- **Warp Routes** enable direct messaging between **Arbitrum Sepolia & GTXpresso**.
- **Mailbox contracts** ensure **secure & reliable** cross-chain message passing.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Espresso's Decentralized Sequencing**

- Fair transaction ordering across chains without centralized control.
- **Synchronized execution** of cross-chain trades.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Open Intents Framework (ERC-7683)**

- Standardized intent execution across chains.
- **Off-chain solvers** optimize order fulfillment for efficiency.

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Dedicated L3 Rollup for Trading**

- **Arbitrum Orbit + Espresso** for **high-speed execution & reduced costs**.
- Built specifically for **cross-chain liquidity aggregation**.

## **üîÑ How WETH to WBTC Swap Operates in GTXpresso**

**1. Initiating an Open Intent (User Action)**

- The user creates an open intent to swap WETH for WBTC on the parent chain, such as Ethereum.
- This intent is signed and transmitted through the **Open Intents Framework (OIF)**.

**2. Transmitting Intent to GTXpresso**

- **Hyperlane** facilitates the relay of the signed swap intent from the parent chain to GTXpresso.
- Upon arrival, the **OIF Router** on GTXpresso authenticates the intent and initiates processing.

**3. Matching Orders & Executing Trades**

- GTXpresso examines its **CLOB order book** for a direct WETH/WBTC market order.
- If a direct market order is available, the trade is executed immediately.
- In the absence of a direct match, GTXpresso employs routing strategies:
  - Initially, WETH is sold for USDC (**Market Order 1**).
  - Subsequently, the obtained USDC is used to purchase WBTC (**Market Order 2**).
- These orders are executed sequentially by GTXpresso using its CLOB liquidity to ensure optimal execution.

**4. Bridging Assets Back to the Parent Chain**

- Once the trade is completed, the acquired WBTC is transferred to the user via the **Hyperlane Bridge**.
- The user receives WBTC on the parent chain, such as Ethereum.

**Key Advantages**

- **Low Latency:** Enables near-instant trade execution within GTXpresso.
- **Optimized Routing:** In the absence of a direct market, GTXpresso routes the trade through USDC for optimal execution (WETH ‚Üí USDC ‚Üí WBTC).
- **Cross-Chain Settlement:** The user interacts solely with the parent chain, while execution occurs within the high-performance GTXpresso rollup.
